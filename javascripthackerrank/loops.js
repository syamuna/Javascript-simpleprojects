*/First, print each vowel in  on a new line. The English vowels are a, e, i, o, and u, and each vowel must be printed in the same order as it appeared in .
Second, print each consonant (i.e., non-vowel) in  on a new line in the same order as it appeared in .*/


solution:
function vowelsAndConsonants(s) {
    let vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];

    for(let v of s) {
        if(vowels.includes(v))
            console.log(v);
    }
    
    for(let v of s) {
        if(!vowels.includes(v))
            console.log(v);
    }
}
